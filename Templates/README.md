# Templates
Templates for different types of pwn problems, largely based on [pwninit's](https://github.com/io12/pwninit) auto-generated script, but tweaked to my preferences and for the common denominator problem types. Also includes sample programs for testing different setups or refreshing your knowledge on pwn.
